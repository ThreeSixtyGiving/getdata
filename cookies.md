A cookie is a small file which asks permission to be placed on your computer's hard drive. Once you agree, the file is added and the cookie helps analyse web traffic or lets you know when you visit a particular site.

Cookies allow web applications to respond to you as an individual. The web application can tailor its operations to your needs, likes and dislikes by gathering and remembering information about your preferences. A cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any information about you, other than the data you choose to share with us.

You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. This may prevent you from taking full advantage of the website.

In this website we use cookies to:

* Help us analyse how our website is used.
* To ensure other sites can’t "forge" requests.

We use <a href="http://piwik.org">Piwik</a> to analyse usage of our website (see Piwik section below). This uses cookies to identify you (anonymously) as the same user, so that we can analyse our web traffic better. E.g. it allows us to count how many users we have, instead of just total page views or analyse what pages people commonly visit together.

If you do allow cookies to be used, Piwik uses 1st party cookies, set on the domain of this website. Cookies created by Piwik start with: 

* _pk_ref
* _pk_cvar
* _pk_id
* _pk_ses

## Piwik Traffic Analytics

We use our own hosted version of <a href="http://piwik.org">Piwik</a> to analyse our web traffic. We do this to get an idea of how much traffic we are getting, where from and when.

If you have set your web browser to "I do not want to be tracked" (DoNotTrack is enabled) then Piwik will not track your visit.

Piwik also it’s own opt out mechanism:
<!-- opt out iframe - clicking this will mean people can opt out of tracking -->
